## EXPOSE

    EXPOSE <port> [<port>/<protocol>...]

The `EXPOSE` instruction informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. You can specify whether the port listens on TCP or UDP, and the default is TCP if the protocol is not specified.

The `EXPOSE` instruction **does not actually publish the port**. It **functions as a type of documentation** between the person who builds the image and the person who runs the container, about which ports are intended to be published. To actually publish the port when running the container, use the `-p` flag on `docker run` to publish and map one or more ports, or the `-P` flag to **publish all exposed ports** and map them to high-order ports.

By default, `EXPOSE` assumes TCP. You can also specify UDP:

    EXPOSE 80/udp

To expose on both TCP and UDP, include two lines:

    EXPOSE 80/tcp
    EXPOSE 80/udp

In this case, if you use `-P` with `docker run`, the port will be exposed once for TCP and once for UDP. Remember that `-P` uses an **ephemeral high-ordered host port** on the host, so **the port will not be the same** for TCP and UDP.

Regardless of the `EXPOSE` settings, you can override them at runtime by using the `-p` flag. For example

    docker run -p 80:80/tcp -p 80:80/udp ...

To set up port redirection on the host system, see [using the `-P` flag](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#expose-incoming-ports). The `docker network` command supports creating networks for communication among containers without the need to expose or publish specific ports, because the containers connected to the network can communicate with each other over any port. For detailed information, see the [overview of this feature](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/).
