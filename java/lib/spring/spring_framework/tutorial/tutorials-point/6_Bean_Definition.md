# [Bean Definition](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/spring/spring_bean_definition.htm)

- [Bean Definition](#bean-definition)
  - [Spring Configuration Metadata](#spring-configuration-metadata)

The **objects** that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by the **Spring IoC container** are called **beans**. A bean is an object that is **instantiated**, **assembled**, and otherwise **managed** by a Spring IoC container. These beans are created with the **configuration metadata** that you supply to the container. For example, in the form of **XML \<bean/\>** definitions which you have already seen in the previous chapters.

Bean definition contains the information called **configuration metadata**, which is needed for the container to know the following −

- How to create a bean
- Bean's lifecycle details
- Bean's dependencies

All the above configuration metadata translates into a set of the following properties that make up each bean definition.

|||
|-|-|
|Sr.No.|Properties & Description|
|1|**class** <br> This attribute is **mandatory** and specifies the bean class to be used to create the bean.|
|2|**name** <br> This attribute specifies the bean identifier **uniquely**. In XMLbased configuration metadata, you use the **id and/or name** attributes to specify the bean identifier(s).|
|3|**scope** <br> This attribute specifies the scope of the objects created from a particular bean definition and it will be discussed in bean scopes chapter.|
|4|**constructor-arg** <br> This is used to inject the dependencies and will be discussed in subsequent chapters.|
|5|**properties** <br> This is used to inject the dependencies and will be discussed in subsequent chapters.|
|6|**autowiring mode** <br> This is used to inject the dependencies and will be discussed in subsequent chapters.|
|7|**lazy-initialization mode** <br> A lazy-initialized bean tells the IoC container to create a bean instance when it is first requested, rather than at the startup.|
|8|**initialization method** <br> A callback to be called just after all necessary properties on the bean have been set by the container. It will be discussed in bean life cycle chapter.|
|9|**destruction method** <br> A callback to be used when the container containing the bean is destroyed. It will be discussed in bean life cycle chapter.|

## Spring Configuration Metadata

Spring IoC container is totally decoupled from the format in which this configuration metadata is actually written. Following are the three important methods to provide **configuration metadata** to the Spring Container −

- XML based configuration file.
- Annotation-based configuration
- Java-based configuration

You already have seen how XML-based configuration metadata is provided to the container, but let us see another sample of XML-based configuration file with different bean definitions including lazy initialization, initialization method, and destruction method −

    <?xml version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"?>

    <beans xmlns = "http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
        xmlns:xsi = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation = "http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd">

        <!-- A simple bean definition -->
        <bean id = "..." class = "...">
            <!-- collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
        </bean>

        <!-- A bean definition with lazy init set on -->
        <bean id = "..." class = "..." lazy-init = "true">
            <!-- collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
        </bean>

        <!-- A bean definition with initialization method -->
        <bean id = "..." class = "..." init-method = "...">
            <!-- collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
        </bean>

        <!-- A bean definition with destruction method -->
        <bean id = "..." class = "..." destroy-method = "...">
            <!-- collaborators and configuration for this bean go here -->
        </bean>

        <!-- more bean definitions go here -->
    
    </beans>

We will discuss about Annotation Based Configuration in a separate chapter. It is intentionally discussed in a separate chapter as we want you to grasp a few other important Spring concepts, before you start programming with Spring Dependency Injection with Annotations.
